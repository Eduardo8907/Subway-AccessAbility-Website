                <h2 >Ted Morris, Bronx, NY:</h2>
                <p>My name is Ted Morris and I’ve been living and working in New York City for over 25 years. When I first moved here, I was not disabled. The MTA was (and, in many repsects, still is) a wonderful service that, for a relatively small amount of money, took me where I needed to go safely and efficiently.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in 2019 my right leg was amputated above the knee. I was confined to a wheelchair for a while, still needing to take public transportation. The buses were a big help and easily accessed, but the trains were a whole other story.</p>
                <p>The limited number of accessible stations make it very difficult to travel between boroughs. I live in the Bronx. It is very hilly, difficult, and dangerous just to travel in a wheelchair or to walk with my prosthetic. Then the sheer number of the stairs at the elevated stations are insurmountable when I’m using the prosthetic and impossible for a wheelchair.</p>
                <p>New York City is one of the most accessible cities in the country and I am grateful for that. My hope is that we can take the next step and add elevators to more train stations and make NYC the number one accessible city in the USA.</p>
