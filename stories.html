            <h2>Eduardo, Maspeth, NY:</h2>
            <p >Aida is a full time mother of two. She recently enrolled her child in school. She started commuting by train, with her younger child in a stroller and the other on a scooter. After a few weeks she became exhausted from constantly having to take the stairs because of out of service elevators. She opted out and started to take car services which is a lot more expensive. <br><br>
            Many moms constantly struggle in stations with their children, strollers and bags. They need the extra help an elevator provides.</p>

            <h2 >Ted Moris, Bronx, NY:</h2>
            <p >My name is Ted Morris and I’ve been living and working in New York City for over 25 years. When I first moved here, I was not disabled. The MTA was (and, in many repsects, still is) a wonderful service that, for a relatively small amount of money, took me where I needed to go safely and efficiently.

                Unfortunately, in 2019 my right leg was aputated above the knee. I was confined to a wheelchair for a while still needing to take public transportation. The buses were a big help and easily accessed, but the trains were a whole other story.
                
                The limited number of accessible stations make it very difficult to travel between boroughs. I live in the Bronx. It is very hilly, difficult, and dangerous just to travel in a wheelchair or to walk with my prosthetic. Then the sheer number of the stairs at the elevated stations are insurmountable when I’m using the prosthetic and impossible for a wheelchair.
                
                New York City is one of the most accessible cities in the country and I am grateful for that. My hope is that we can take the next step and add elevators to more train stations and make NYC the number one accessible city in the USA.
